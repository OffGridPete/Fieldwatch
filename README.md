# Fieldwatch

I built Fieldwatch as a personal tool to look at what Wi-Fi access points and Bluetooth LE ads my phone was able to pick up, so that I could better understand what devices were being used around me. It’s passive, it only listens, there’s no dongle, no account, and no backend server. I wanted something that would work offline in the field.

My goals were to have a modern interface that was easy to use, flexible in how information was displayed so I could customize a view based on what I was trying to do, a filtering engine so I do not have to look at everything, an extensible signature library so I can identify as many radio sources as possible and add new ones on the fly, as well as create reports of what was seen.

I have been using it and iterating on it for a while now, and it has been useful enough that I thought I would share it.

This is a hobby — something I do for fun in my spare time. There is no Fieldwatch backend. There are no ads. Everything lives on the phone. Source and sideload files are in this repository (`dist/` for the APK, instruction card, and manual).

It was Spectre through 1.2.14. I later learned that name was already in use by another app, so I renamed this one Fieldwatch to keep the two from being mixed up. Same field tool, new application id (`app.fieldwatch`), MIT License. Installing Fieldwatch does not replace Spectre on a phone; it is a separate app.

If you spot an error, something stupid, or have a feature idea — in the app or the documentation — please [open an issue on this repository](https://github.com/OffGridPete/Fieldwatch/issues). This is how we make it better. I hope you find it as useful as I have. I look forward to hearing how it goes.

**Just want to install it?** The [Latest release](https://github.com/OffGridPete/Fieldwatch/releases/latest) has the APK, or download [Fieldwatch.apk](https://github.com/OffGridPete/Fieldwatch/raw/main/dist/Fieldwatch.apk) from `dist/`. Instruction card and manual: [instruction.txt](https://github.com/OffGridPete/Fieldwatch/raw/main/dist/instruction.txt), [Fieldwatch_User_Manual.pdf](https://github.com/OffGridPete/Fieldwatch/raw/main/dist/Fieldwatch_User_Manual.pdf). Leave the APK named `Fieldwatch.apk`. GitHub may say the file is too big to preview — that is their viewer; use Download.

## Safety & disclaimer

This is a hobby project, provided as-is under the MIT License. A few things to know before you do:

- Use at your own risk. Using Fieldwatch is your responsibility. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Off Grid Pete LLC is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from its use.
- There is no guarantee that trackers, cameras, tags, access points, or any other device will be found, named, or reported. Radios that are off, cellular-only, asleep, randomized, quiet, or outside what this handset’s OS exposes will not appear. Each phone has its own radios, firmware, scan quotas, and OEM battery policies. Software cannot address those limits.
- Pattern matches, GPS co-travel (“Moving with you” / “possible tail”), Debrief language, and AI Export output are hypotheses — not identity, not a legal finding, and not a complete RF capture. You are solely responsible for how you use this app and this document, and for complying with local law. By using the software or this manual you accept these terms and the MIT License.
- Location data, if tagging is on, is this phone at hear-time — not the other radio. There is no Fieldwatch server. Stamps stay on the handset until you share them. Logs keep full coordinates even when Privacy mode masks the screen and sit reports. Debrief, Share log, AI Export (sit or one radio), and radio-detail Share as text can take that path off the phone. Online place names use the system geocoder (often the OEM / Google network), not a Fieldwatch cloud. How you store, share, or publish those files is your responsibility.

## Put it on a phone

On a phone, the install files are in [`dist/`](https://github.com/OffGridPete/Fieldwatch/tree/main/dist), not the root of the repo:

- [Fieldwatch.apk](https://github.com/OffGridPete/Fieldwatch/raw/main/dist/Fieldwatch.apk)
- [instruction.txt](https://github.com/OffGridPete/Fieldwatch/raw/main/dist/instruction.txt)
- [Fieldwatch_User_Manual.pdf](https://github.com/OffGridPete/Fieldwatch/raw/main/dist/Fieldwatch_User_Manual.pdf)

Do not rename the APK. Open `Fieldwatch.apk` from Files (or My Files). Allow install from that app if Android asks.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `dist/Fieldwatch.apk` | Sideload APK |
| `dist/instruction.txt` | Permissions, first launch |
| `dist/Fieldwatch_User_Manual.pdf` | User manual |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | What changed in each build |
| `LICENSE` | MIT License |
| `NOTICE` | Third-party attribution |

Android 10+. Allow install from the app you used to open the APK. Play Protect may warn that it is not from Play — expected. Full steps are in `instruction.txt`.

```bash
adb install -r dist/Fieldwatch.apk
```

Fieldwatch will not overwrite an existing Spectre install (`app.spectre`). Uninstall Spectre when you no longer need it.

Signature packs exported from Spectre (`spectre-signatures`) still import.

## What Fieldwatch is not

- Not Wi-Fi clients, probe-only stations, or 802.11 monitor mode
- Not Bluetooth Classic inquiry (HC-05 / HC-06 will not appear)
- Not cellular
- Not direction finding
